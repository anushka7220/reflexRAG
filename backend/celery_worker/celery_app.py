# celery_worker/celery_app.py
#
# Configures the Celery application and connects it to Redis as the broker.
#
# HOW CELERY WORKS WITH FASTAPI:
# FastAPI and Celery are two separate processes. They do not share memory.
# They communicate only through Redis:
#
#   FastAPI (web process)
#       calls: ingest_repo.delay(repo_id, github_url)
#       pushes a message to Redis
#
#   Celery worker (background process)
#       reads the message from Redis
#       calls the actual task function
#       writes results to Supabase (not back to FastAPI)
#
# WHY NO RESULT BACKEND:
# Ingestion progress is written directly to Supabase ingestion_jobs by the
# orchestrator. The frontend polls that table via the status endpoint.
# Using a separate Celery result backend would be redundant.
#python -m celery -A celery_worker.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
