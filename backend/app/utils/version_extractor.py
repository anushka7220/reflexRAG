# version_extractor.py
#
# Finds the nearest release version tag for a given datetime.
# Used by the Chunker to annotate every chunk with the version that
# was current when the source object was created.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# The critic uses version_tag to detect version mismatches.
# "This answer is based on a chunk from v0.2 but you asked about v0.4"
# Only possible if every chunk carries its version context.
#
# HOW THE VERSION MAP WORKS:
# The orchestrator builds a dict: {release_created_at: tag_name}
# sorted by datetime. For any issue/PR created_at, we find the most
# recent release that came BEFORE it. That's the version it belonged to.
