# decision_extractor.py — v2
#
# ARCHITECTURE: Parallel multi-agent decision extraction with reconciliation.
#
# WHY THIS DESIGN:
# A single LLM call per PR has a fundamental problem — the model conflates
# "what was decided" with "what was discussed" and "what was rejected" with
# "what was deferred." These are different things and a single prompt trying
# to extract all three at once produces mediocre results for all three.
#
# Solution: three specialized agents, each with a narrow job, running in
# parallel on the same PR text. Then a reconciliation step that merges
# their outputs and flags disagreements rather than silently picking one.
#
# AGENT ROLES:
#   Agent 1 — Decider:  "What concrete decision was made in this thread?"
#   Agent 2 — Rejector: "What alternatives were explicitly rejected, and why?"
#   Agent 3 — Skeptic:  "How confident are we in the above? Flag conflicts."
#
# RECONCILIATION:
#   If agents agree → merge into a DecisionNode with high confidence.
#   If agents disagree → either re-run with a tighter prompt (max 1 retry)
#                         or store the conflict explicitly for the UI to surface.
#
# ORCHESTRATION: asyncio.gather() runs all three agents truly in parallel.
# Three Gemini Flash calls fire simultaneously — total latency = slowest agent,
# not sum of all three.

DECIDER_PROMPT = """You are a precise technical analyst. Your ONLY job is to identify the single concrete decision made in this GitHub PR or issue thread.

A "decision" means: something was chosen, implemented, or agreed upon. Not discussed. Not proposed. Actually decided.

If no concrete decision was made (e.g. it's just a bug report, a question, or an unresolved discussion), respond with:
{{"decision": null, "confidence": 0.0}}

If a decision was made, respond with:
{{"decision": "one sentence describing what was decided", "confidence": 0.0-1.0}}

Confidence guide:
- 1.0: Explicitly stated ("we decided to...", "going with X", PR merged with clear purpose)
- 0.7: Clearly implied by the merge and context
- 0.4: Inferred — not explicitly stated
- 0.0: No decision found

REJECTOR_PROMPT = """You are a precise technical analyst. Your ONLY job is to identify alternatives that were EXPLICITLY rejected in this GitHub PR or issue thread.

Rules:
- "Rejected" means: considered and ruled out, not just unmentioned.
- "Deferred" is NOT rejected. If something was deferred, say so.
- Only include alternatives with explicit reasons given.
- If nothing was explicitly rejected, return an empty list.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:

  "alternatives": [

Extraction 1 (Decider agent):

Your job:
1. Does the decision in Extraction 1 actually look like a decision, or is it vague/wrong?
2. Are the rejections in Extraction 2 genuinely explicit, or inferred/hallucinated?
3. Do Extractions 1 and 2 contradict each other?
