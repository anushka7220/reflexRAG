# contributor_builder.py
#
# Computes ownership scores, authority scores, and file area data from
# commit history and PR review patterns. No LLM calls. Pure computation.
#
# WHY NO LLM HERE:
# Ownership and authority are derivable facts from git history.
# Who committed to a file, how often, how recently. Who reviewed PRs
# and whose approval correlated with the PR getting merged.
# An LLM would only add latency and cost without improving accuracy.
#
# OWNERSHIP SCORE:
# Weighted by recency. A commit from last month counts more than a
# commit from three years ago. Formula:
#   score = sum(recency_weight(commit) for commit in their commits to this file)
#           / sum(recency_weight(commit) for all commits to this file)
#
# AUTHORITY SCORE:
# Measures how often a reviewer's approval correlates with a merge.
#   score = prs_they_approved_that_merged / total_prs_they_reviewed
#
# FILE AREAS:
# Files are grouped by their top level directory as a simple area boundary.
# Co-change tracking counts how often two areas appear in the same commit.
