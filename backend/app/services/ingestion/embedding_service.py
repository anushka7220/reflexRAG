# embedding_service.py
#
# Converts text into 1024-dimensional float vectors using bge-large-en-v1.5.
# No API key required. Model runs locally via sentence-transformers.
#
# WHY bge-large-en-v1.5:
# Strong performance on retrieval benchmarks. 1024 dimensions gives good
# precision. Free to run. Already used at Memeraki so the pattern is familiar.
# Tradeoff: 1.3GB RAM, ~15s load time on first call.
#
# SINGLETON PATTERN:
# The model is loaded once when first used (lazy init) and reused forever.
# Loading on every request would add 15s latency to each embedding call.
#
# BATCHING:
# Embedding 10,000 chunks one at a time = 10,000 forward passes.
# Batching 64 chunks at a time = ~157 forward passes. Same result, 50x faster.
# Batch size 64 is a safe default that fits in 512MB RAM.
