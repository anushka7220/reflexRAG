# chunker.py
#
# Splits raw GitHub objects into embedding-ready chunks with metadata attached.
#
# WHY CHUNKING EXISTS:
# bge-large-en-v1.5 has a 512-token input limit. GitHub issue bodies can be
# 10,000+ tokens. Without chunking, the model silently truncates everything
# past token 512. You'd embed only the first ~400 words of every long issue.
#
# WHY OVERLAP:
# If we split at hard boundaries, a sentence can be cut in half:
#   Chunk 1: "...the root cause was identified as an off-by-one error in the"
#   Chunk 2: "pagination logic, which was fixed in commit abc123."
# Neither chunk alone tells the full story. With 50-token overlap, the end
# of chunk 1 appears at the start of chunk 2 — context is preserved.
#
# WHAT GETS ATTACHED TO EVERY CHUNK:
# source_type, source_id, status, created_at, version_tag, content_hash
# These fields are what make the critic possible — it reads metadata, not text.
